* The Five Dysfunctions of a Team
Book club with Kirk and Digital SI&T team
** Lencioni
** Notes
*** Decision Tech - 150 employees
- 2 years investors lining up
- exec backstabbing
- slipping deadlines
- key non-execs leaving
- morale low, no unity/camraderie, political/unpleasant place to work
*** 0 days
Jeff Shanley, down from CEO to biz dev
*** 3w
Kathryn hired as CEO, old school, blue collar exp. (no tech)
chairman picked
*** 5w
kathryn "did almost nothing"
interviewed direct reports
walked the halls, observed meetings
left Jeff in charge of staff meetings
announced serious of 2-day exec offsites, her agenda
kathryn's diagnosis - !team
** Takeaways
*** surpised kathryn was hir3ed - importance to Chairman of creatinga  strong team vs. expected/exact role fit
*** Kathryn's directness
w/ chairman - you can't do this, you hired me, do you trust me?
w/ team - show up to the offsite, team is most important and some people changes expected
*** Martin
very passive aggressive in beginning (customer opportunity email, push Jeff S to oppose offsite, pushed chairman)
